#' Computes synthetic diff-in-diff estimate for an average treatment effect on a treated block.
#' See Section 4.1 of the paper.
#' @param Y the observation matrix.
#' @param N0 the number of control units. Rows 1-N0 of Y correspond to the control units.
#' @param T0 the number of pre-treatment time steps. Columns 1-T0 of Y correspond to pre-treatment time steps.
#' @param X an optional 3-D array of time-varying covariates. Shape should be N X T X C for C covariates.
#' @param zeta.lambda Its square is weight of the ridge penalty relative to MSE. Defaults to 0.
#' @param zeta.omega Analogous for omega. Defaults to the standard deviation of first differences of Y.
#' @param lambda.intercept Binary. Use an intercept when estimating lambda.
#' @param omega.intercept Binary. Use an intercept when estimating omega.
#' @param weights a list with fields lambda and omega. If non-null weights$lambda is passed,
#'        we use them instead of estimating lambda weights. Same for weights$omega.
#' @param update.lambda If true, solve for lambda using the passed value of weights$lambda only as an initialization.
#'        If false, use it exactly as passed. Defaults to false if a non-null value of weights$lambda is passed.
#' @param update.omega  Analogous.
#' @param min.decrease Tunes a stopping criterion for our weight estimator. Stop after an iteration results in a decrease
#' 		        in penalized MSE smaller than min.decrease^2.
#' @param max.iter A fallback stopping criterion for our weight estimator. Stop after this number of iterations.
#' @return An average treatment effect estimate, 'weights' and 'setup' attached as attributes.
#'         Weights contains the estimated weights lambda and omega and corresponding intercepts.
#'         If covariates X are passedas well as regression coefficients beta if X is passed
#'         Setup is a list describing the problem passed in: Y, N0, T0, X.
