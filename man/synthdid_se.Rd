\title{An estimate of the standard error of our estimator via unit-wise jackknife.
Should not be trusted when the number of treated units is small, and returns NA if there is only one treated unit.
By default, does not recompute the weights omega and lambda. Instead, weights$lambda and weights$beta will be used unchanged and
weights$omega will have jackknifed-out units removed then be renormalized to sum to one.
Pass weights=NULL to recompute weights for each jackknife replication.
Requires bootstrap}
